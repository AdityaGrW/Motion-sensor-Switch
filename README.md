# Motion-sensor-Switch
This project shows how to make a low cost motion sensor light switch using the CD4017 IC and IR proximity sensor. You can use this motion activated light circuit as an automatic room light switch. Here, each time the IR proximity sensor sense detects any motion, it send the clock pulse to CD4017 IC. Then the 4017 changes its previous state.
